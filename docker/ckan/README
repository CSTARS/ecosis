This is for the ecosis/ckan-base docker image setup.

First run docker build
```
docker build -t ecosis/ckan-base:[version] .
```

But you are not done.  Then
```
# tail cmd keeps docker alive while you install
docker run -d --name=ckan ecosis/ckan-base:[version] tail -f /dev/null
docker exec -ti ckan bash
```

Once on the machine run.
```
./ckan_install.sh
```

And and preform the following edits:

Edit /etc/ckan/default/development.ini
- update pg connection: sqlalchemy.url = postgresql://ckan_default:ckan_default@localhost/ckan_default"
- update solr connection: solr_url=http://127.0.0.1:8983/solr/ckan


Then run
```
./ckan_install_p2.sh
```

If all is well, this should work:
```
/run.sh
```

Commit final product
```
docker commit [container id] ecosis/ckan-base:[version]
```
