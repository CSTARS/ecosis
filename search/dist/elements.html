The `x-style` extension of the native `<style>` element allows defining styles
in the main document that can take advantage of several special features of
Polymer's styling system:

* Document styles defined in an `x-style` will be shimmed to ensure they do
not leak into local DOM when running on browsers without non-native Shadow DOM.
* Shadow DOM-specific `/deep/` and `::shadow` combinators will be shimmed on
browsers without non-native Shadow DOM.
* Custom properties used by Polymer's experimental shim for cross-scope styling
may be defined in an `x-style`.

Example:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <script src="components/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-lite.js"></script>
  <link rel="import" href="components/polymer/polymer.html">

  <style is="x-style">
    
    /* Will be prevented from affecting local DOM of Polymer elements */
    * {
      box-sizing: border-box;
    }
    
    /* Can use /deep/ and ::shadow combinators */
    body /deep/ .my-special-view::shadow #thing-inside {
      background: yellow;
    }
    
    /* Custom properties that inherit down the document tree may be defined */
    body {
      --my-toolbar-title-color: green;
    }
    
  </style>

</head>
<body>

    ...

</body>
</html>
```

Note, all features of `x-style` are available when defining styles as part of Polymer elements (e.g. `<style>` elements within `<dom-module>`'s used for defining Polymer elements. The `x-style` extension should only be used for defining document styles, outside of a custom element's local DOM.

**THIS ELEMENT IS EXPERIMENTAL.  API AND NAME SUBJECT TO CHANGE.**

Polymer's binding features are only available within templates that are managed
by Polymer.  As such, these features are available in templates used to define
Polymer elements, for example, but not for elements placed directly in the main
document.

In order to use Polymer bindings without defining a new custom element, elements
utilizing bindings may be wrapped with the `x-autobind` template extension.
This template will immediately stamp itself into the main document and bind
elements to the template itself as the binding scope.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <script src="components/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-lite.js"></script>
  <link rel="import" href="components/polymer/polymer.html">
  <link rel="import" href="components/core-ajax/core-ajax.html">

</head>
<body>

  <template is="x-autobind">

    <core-ajax url="http://..." lastresponse="{{data}}"></core-ajax>

    <template is="x-repeat" items="{{data}}">
        <div><span>{{item.first}}</span> <span>{{item.last}}</span></div>
    </template>

  </template>

</body>

**THIS ELEMENT IS EXPERIMENTAL.  API AND NAME SUBJECT TO CHANGE.**

The `x-repeat` element is a custom `HTMLTemplateElement` type extension that
automatically stamps and binds one instance of template content to each object
in a user-provided array.  `x-repeat` accepts an `items` property, and one
instance of the template is stamped for each item into the DOM at the location
of the `x-repeat` element.  The `item` property will be set on each instance's
binding scope, thus templates should bind to sub-properties of `item`.

Example:

```html
<dom-module id="employee-list">

  <template>

    <div> Employee list: </div>
    <template is="x-repeat" items="{{employees}}">
        <div>First name: <span>{{item.first}}</span></div>
        <div>Last name: <span>{{item.last}}</span></div>
    </template>

  </template>

  <script>
    Polymer({
      is: 'employee-list',
      ready: function() {
        this.employees = [
            {first: 'Bob', last: 'Smith'},
            {first: 'Sally', last: 'Johnson'},
            ...

      }
    });
  </script>

</dom-module>
```

Notifications for changes to items sub-properties will be forwarded to template
instances, which will update via the normal structured data notification system.

Mutations to the `items` array itself (`push`, `pop`, `splice`, `shift`,
`unshift`) are observed via `Array.observe` (where supported, or an
shim of this API on unsupported browsers), and template instances are kept in
sync with the data in the array.

A view-specific filter/sort may be applied to each `x-repeat` by supplying a
`filter` and/or `sort` property.  This may be a string that names a function on
the host, or a function may be assigned to the property directly.  The functions
should implemented following the standard `Array` filter/sort API.

In order to re-run the filter or sort functions based on changes to sub-fields
of `items`, the `observe` property may be set as a space-separated list of
`item` sub-fields that should cause a re-filter/sort when modified.

For example, for an `x-repeat` with a filter of the following:

```js
isEngineer: function(item) {
    return item.type == 'engineer' || item.manager.type == 'engineer';
}
```

Then the `observe` property should be configured as follows:

```html
<template is="x-repeat" items="{{employees}}"
          filter="isEngineer" observe="type manager.type">
```

<!--
Keeping structured data in sync requires that Polymer understand the path
associations of data being bound.  The `x-array-selector` element ensures path
linkage when selecting specific items from an array (either single or multiple).
The `items` property accepts an array of user data, and via the `select(item)`
and `deselect(item)` API, updates the `selected` property which may be bound to
other parts of the application, and any changes to sub-fields of `selected`
item(s) will be kept in sync with items in the `items` array.  When `multi`
is false, `selected` is a property representing the last selected item.  When
`multi` is true, `selected` is an array of multiply selected items.
